# Build-and-Train-a-Neural-Network

I'll be using the Fashion-MNIST dataset, a drop-in replacement for the MNIST dataset. MNIST is actually quite trivial with neural networks where you can easily achieve better than 97% accuracy. Fashion-MNIST is a set of 28x28 greyscale images of clothes. It's more complex than MNIST, so it's a better representation of the actual performance of your network, and a better representation of datasets you'll use in the real world.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8
- Pytorch 

## Steps 
- Load the datasets using `torchvision`. [Fashion-MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)
- You can see one of the images like this
